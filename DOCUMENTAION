    The main page is code that interacts with a server and was inspired by education perfect. You have features like classes that allow you to see their score and chat with them.

    You can also make quizzes that you can upload to a server for others to play. When you get a question right you can level up, you also have a login system so all your data is saved.



    == HOW TO FIX ==

    1. Import Error: this could be because of a library is not installed

        1.1. Fix pip install package_name

        1.2. Or install package_name --upgrade



    2. requests.exceptions.ConnectionError: happens because code could not connect to the server

        2.2. Fix check that the server is running on a local host port should be on http://localhost:5000



    3. password or name is incorrect please try again or make an account:

        3.1. Fix create new w account and delete other accounts

        3.2. check that you password is in the password.txt file and check  that it does not have any ^: or # in it could create some errors



    4.You might get error when downloading a quiz just check that the name matches you don’t have to include the #

    This code sets up a Flask server with several routes for handling user data. It first checks if necessary libraries are installed and prompts the user to create

    two files for storing data. It then defines routes for sending and receiving user data, including checking passwords, writing new passwords, updating user scores,

    and changing user classes.



    == HOW TO FIX ==

    1. Import Error: this could be because of a library is not installed

        1.1. Fix pip install package_name

        1.2. Or install package_name --upgrade



    2. FileNotFoundError:

        2.1. Check that file names and directories are right  

        2.2. Check that template_folder is right should be where the html files are



    3. Chat server full

        3.1. Add new servers by copping the code but the servers should sort clear automatically

        3.2. You can restart the server to clear the chats or if there is no one in the chat



    4. Html status errors

        4.1. If 404 end of the address in not right

        4.2. If 304 Indicates that the resource has not been modified since the version specified by the request headers If-Modified-Since or If-None-Match. In such case,

             there is no need to retransmit the resource since the client still has a previously-downloaded copy.

        4.3. If 500 see what the directory is and then see if there is anything wrong

        4.4. Any other errors go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes



    == API ==

    How to use the API in your own programs:



        1. Import requests you might need to pip install it



        2.Start off by ping the server with  

            Response = requests.get("http://localhost:5000/ping")

            Server = response.text

            Print(server)



        3. Next you need to understand how the servers work. For most of the functions you need to give the name and sometimes the password this allows the server to identify the user.



        4.Lets say that you want to make see what level a account is first you will have to assine the data that will be sent this can be done like this  

            Data_N = {

                    "name": name,

                    "password": password

                }

                response = requests.post<strong>("http://localhost:5000/send_data_level", json=data_N)

            Server = response.text

            Print(server)



        5. This is the basic way that the server work but there are exceptions to this
